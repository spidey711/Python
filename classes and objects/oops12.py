'''
Define a Point3D class that inherits from object inside the Point3D class. 
Define an __init__() function that accepts self, x, y, and z and assigns these numbers to the member variables self.x,self.y,self.z. 
Define a __repr__() method that returns "(%d, %d, %d)" % (self.x, self.y, self.z). 
This tells Python to represent this object in the following format: (x, y, z). 
Outside the class definition, create a variable named my_point containing a new instance of Point3D with x=1, y=2, and z=3. 
Finally, print my_point.
